    <h3>Chapter 1: The house</h3>
    <div class="text">
      This was my room, with an old mattress with several springs piercing my back, next to an amazingly cold wall. But some of my old plants were there, a great portrait of a sheep, and of course plenty of cows outside my window who would gather if you started whistling or singing.

      The house was very old and somehow crooked. Ossian would have to duck every time he came across one of those wooden beams.

      There were 2 floors, plenty of rooms, and communal areas with a piano and other musical instruments, masks, including two boar heads, a projector and a fire place.

      There were also a few things forgotten outside from the summer time including a hammock and a piano.

      The cold was immense. I am still not sure whether it was just me coming from sunny Greece, or whether it really was that cold. Outdoors, we would wear our warmest clothes including scarfs, hats, gloves and so on. Indoors, it wasn’t much better. We had an electrical heater constantly on on any room we would spend time in. The shower was located right at the entrance, isolated from the rest of the house, and whatever warmth there was. Hot water was also in very short supply and not available on a daily basis. Showers were scarce. One of the household’s projects the first couple of weeks were insulation hacks to keep the house a bit warmer. Ossian added a curtain to their door, and later pieces of wood to cover up the various holes on the old door (my door had wide gaps between the pieces of wood that made it easy to see who was walking up and down the hallway). They sewed blankets to some curtains for the windows downstairs, and sealed with a plastic layer the rest of the windows.

    <h3>Chapter 2: Before birth</h3>
    <div class="text">
      I knew Tara was pregnant, of course, but I wasn’t prepared. I think the first couple of days I couldn’t stop laughing every time I saw her.
    </div>
    <img class="photo" src="/images/photos/mayako/11.jpg" />
    <div class="text">
      The first two weeks were very quiet and easy-going. The big event of the day would be walking to the church nearby for sunset and walk back. That 20 min walk was pretty much at the edge of manageable for Tara.
    </div>
    <img class="photo" src="/images/photos/mayako/12.jpg" />
    <div class="text">
      Other than that, we would have small walks around the house, picking fruit, buying food, a lot of talking, some movies or tv series, even spent a couple of nights all reading books in front of the fireplace.

      Oh, and we played Catan a couple of times. Tara kept repacking her hospital bag, and we had bets running on what date the baby would arrive. Until during a game of Catan Ossian got a call, hang up shortly after and said, sorry guys I don’t think we’ll finish this. Tara’s water just broke. I remember how anxious I got immediately, which was weird because I had nothing to do with all that energy, we were not in any hurry.
    </div> 
    <h3>Chapter 3: Birth</h3> 
    <div class="text">
      Unlike what I had seen in movies, babies don’t pop out 5 minutes after the water breaks. In our case, we waited it out. Tara and Ossian did some final preparations and I made us 2kg of pasta to fuel us the coming day. Here Tara is brushing her teeth before going to bed that night.
    </div>
    <img class="photo" src="/images/photos/mayako/19.jpg" />
    <div class="text">
      She didn’t get much sleep. The contractions started a couple of hours after the water broke and reached a 5 minute frequency by 11-12am the next day when we decided to head to the hospital.  This was all according to Tara’s and her doula’s plan. Two cars, Tara, Ossian, me and the doula. The way she managed pain was amazing. She would bounce up and down and sing. So she would do that for a few seconds every 5 minutes or so, and would be normal otherwise. We had this discussion in the car trying to determine how bad the pain was – she was handling it great but was concerned about how much worse it was going to get. As it turned out, not too much. We arrived at the hospital, and an hour and a half later Tara had given birth. I wasn’t present. I was sitting outside with Ossian waiting and hearing weird sounds of pterodactyl nearby. And of Tara chanting καρδιά μου and αγάπη μου in an attempt to embrace the pain. When we were called in, Tara was sitting inside the bathtub holding her baby. That sight was the most moving thing I have ever seen. The midwives were calling her an Earth goddess. Tara was eager to show her creation. One midwife put a peg on the umbilical cord and asked Ossian to cut it. He was given one of those cheap scissors I remember from primary school. It wasn’t an easy cut. Apparently, you just wait for the remaining umbilical cord to decide to fall off. We left the peg in place.

      A few things that I hadn’t realized until then:
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      Babies can have long fingernails.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      The hue of a newborn is wrong. Its somewhere between grey and purple. And it kept changing colours every 5 minutes or so before settling into a redish pink. It is also covered in a layer of something that in the beginning is a bit brown and sticky and then becomes more like powder. They used to wash that off in the past, but not anymore.
    </div>
    <img class="photo" src="/images/photos/mayako/21.jpg" />
    <div class="text">
      The baby was born in water, with the umbilical cord wrapped around her neck thrice. There is no choking hazard as the baby doesn’t breathe yet from the mouth. The main problem in such cases is when the umbilical cord becomes so short after the neck wrapping that it won’t allow the baby to come out. Thankfully Tara’s cord was so long they compared it to a skipping rope.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      When the baby is born, the birth is not over.  You still have to wait for the placenta to come out. The sight of the placenta and the umbilical cord sitting there in a corner was fairly unsettling.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      Breastfeeding is hard. There are all these details you need to pay attention to, and technique to be developed by both mother and baby. With Tara as exhausted as she was, the task was almost impossible.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      The best way to hold a newborn is skin to skin. Apparently, they understand all kinds of stuff through touch and it’s the best way to keep them as warm as necessary.
    </div>
    <img class="photo" src="/images/photos/mayako/22.jpg" />
    <div class="text">
      The first shock came when Bu coughed up something red-yellowish and we freaked out. We immediately called a midwife who told us that it’s probably just remnants of what the lungs were filled with along with some blood from labour. Not something to worry about as long as it doesn’t happen again.
    </div>
    <img class="photo" src="/images/photos/mayako/23.jpg" />
    <div class="text">
      The second shock came after a few hours of chilling when Tara finally tried to stand up and walk. She had been quite dizzy, weak and tired. After pushing herself upright decisively, something fell to the floor that can only be described as a kidney. Tara was genuinely convinced that it was her kidney. The midwife thought that it was a blood clot that became fairly solid after the few hours of lying down. The midwife’s interpretation sounded much better.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      It was amazing seeing a totally new expression in Tara’s face. I think it lasted for about 4-5 days.
    </div>
    <img class="photo" src="/images/photos/mayako/24.jpg" />
    <div class="text">
      A big shout out to NHS here. The treatment we got from the hospital was pretty amazing. We got a room for ourselves that included a bath tab for the birth, a bed, and a big bathroom, and stayed there for most of the day. We were able to turn the lighting fairly low and spread various personal items around to feel much more comfortable. There were 2 midwives present at birth and 1 checking on us continuously. All checks for Tara and the baby were all carried out in that room in a comfortable atmosphere. Tara was given her first lessons on breastfeeding there and a lot of advice about the baby. On top of all that, we had a midwife visiting every day at home for the first 3 days, then again on the 5th and then every few days to check on both baby and mother.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      Fun fact – they wouldn’t let us leave the hospital until we had the baby properly strapped on the baby seat we were going to use in the car.
    </div>
    <h3>Chapter 4: After birth</h3> 
    <div class="text">
      The first couple of weeks were all about survival. Breathing, feeding, sleeping. In the first few days everyone was exhausted, and at the same time very much worried about the baby. One did not help the other. Sleeping became important from day one.
    </div>
    <img class="photo" src="/images/photos/mayako/25.jpg" />
    <div class="text">
      Mayako was feeding in about 2-hour cycles. Typically, she would get fed, changed, briefly fed again and held to fall asleep, then transferred to her cot that would somewhat wake her and wait for her to fall asleep again. If that didn’t work, you had to start over again. That left about an hour of sleep at a time, so every minute counted. The obvious way to make the routine more efficient was to let Mayako sleep on whoever was holding her, but if that person fell asleep as well, it became a hazard. So I took the night shift and started watching over the couple while they slept with Mayako on them, making sure they won’t fall on her, and also helping out a bit on the feeding routine and keeping some company to the half-asleep parents. Video games were my friend.
    </div>
    <img class="photo" src="/images/photos/mayako/26.jpg" />
    <div class="text">
      Babies are amazingly useless. I am not talking about talking, walking, painting, all those high-level skills. I am talking about very basic skills like breathing, digesting and sleeping. Breathing kept sounding irregular and forced like there was something stuck in her throat. Which was worrying, especially because newborns are also missing other useful skills like coughing. Breastfeeding was difficult. Technique and positioning were a concern, especially as Tara had difficulty to sit due to constant pain in her tailbone, but also quantity. Is she eating enough? Is she throwing up too much? Around the third day, Mayako decided to eat properly so she gave up on sleep and started sucking relentlessly for 12 hours. This is how milk is made.
    </div>
    <img class="photo" src="/images/photos/mayako/27.jpg" />
    <div class="text">
      Feeding was also a concern for Tara as she needed a constant supply of food around the clock. The few times she went hungry and crushed out of energy were unpleasant for everyone involved. We made lists. Dried nuts, fruit, peanut butter and water were in constant supply in the room. If we run out they had to be replenished immediately. Boiled eggs, potatoes, carrots, yogurt, hummus, tinned mackerel, chocolate, oats, and milk were always a short walk away in the kitchen.
    </div>
    <img class="photo" src="/images/photos/mayako/28.jpg" />
    <div class="text">
      We had the first walk outside on day 4.
    </div>
    <img class="photo" src="/images/photos/mayako/29.jpg" />
    <div class="text">
      And again, on day 7.
    </div>
    <img class="photo" src="/images/photos/mayako/30.jpg" />
    <div class="text">
      The two-week mark was a changing point. By then we had mastered the routine, but now Ossian had to go back to work. Two weeks was also the amount of time Tara had set herself in quarantine.
    </div>
    <img class="photo" src="/images/photos/mayako/31.jpg" />
    <div class="text">
      Up until then, Tara had pretty much restricted herself in her room, avoiding most contact with the rest of the household, and any contact with outsiders. We could now accept visitors in the house, and we could start using the upstairs toilet that was closer to our bedrooms and more importantly, warm. Ossian’s mother and sister came first.
    </div>
    <img class="photo" src="/images/photos/mayako/32.jpg" />
    <div class="text">
      Around that time it also became apparent that the couple would need to move houses soon. I said my goodbyes to the cows.

      A couple of days ago I took the tube and as always there were people asking for money in the trains. It’s actually pretty bad. You might get a different one on every stop. And they come in all kind of flavours. You get the addicts, the homeless, the immigrants, and lately more and more, normal looking people, in their 40s, 50s, 60s. You get even older ones, looking very similar to my own grandparents but these do not walk much and prefer to beg sitting down on entrances or other public places.

      On that particular day, a young immigrant was crawling in all fours across the carriages asking for help. Saying I am begging you on my knees, what more can I do? Claiming the hunger was painful and he preferred not to stand. There wasn’t a lot of help coming. A couple of older women asked him to stop being silly and stand up. Not aggressively. One held him to stand, maybe she even gave him something. I felt like shit. It hit me pretty bad for some reason. I didn’t give him anything. I felt like this was such an exercise in futility. I felt I couldn’t possibly help him and people like him. Not in a meaningful way. Not in a big city like this, with so many people in need.

      In my hometown, with a population of 3k, people can really come together to help someone. Its clear who is in need, there are no games, and its much clearer what you can do about it in a much more sustainable way. We have a few people that live off charity but they never beg. We know who they are, and people offer them food and clothing and so on in an ongoing basis. Not money. That incident made me feel I should really aim to go live in a smaller place. A place I can know and understand better. A place I can feel part of. A place I can even try to improve in any small way.

      For many years I have discussed with various friends settling in a small place – a small village, a farm, a collective, whatever. It’s always a romantic idea, never really serious. But it always sounds nice. I was having this discussion again just a week ago with another friend, Kostas, while we were visiting Pilio, and since you are all in the list of people I’d like to take with, I thought I should share our latest candidate.

      Pilio is a mountainous area littered with many small villages. Here you can see the entrance to the one we stayed in. Its tiny, and pretty much all built from stone. No cars go in.

      Notice the stone roof tiles, and how awesome even their older buildings look

      Everyone gathers in the main square of the village, because this is literally where all the shops are. And all strays are taken care of, even the very old blind ones.

      And they have this crazy tradition with tsipouradika – places where you go to drink tsipouro – a heavily alcoholic bevarage very similar to raki. So you go there, you sit down, and you order tsipouro. One each. It comes in these small bottles you can see in the background, about 100ml each. You pay about 2.5 – 3 euro each. But the amazing thing is that for each tsipouro, they also bring you a “meze”, something to eat with it. So if its 4 of you and all order tsipouro you will also gett 4 things to nibble on. And the more you order, the bigger the plates get. Here we are at the 3-4 round and each of these plates came as complementary plate to our 3 euro tsipouro. Most of them are fish. And if you see just one fish on the plate its because we ate the other 3. Yes, seriously.

      As i mentioned, the villages are very small, but driving for half an hour can get you to a larger town (about 150k population), great beaches (didn’t have time to visit, so no photos, sorry), a ski resort in the winter and amazing hikes all year around. You can walk for hours in forests.

      You can walk along rivers and bathe in waterfalls.

      And chase as many frogs you could care for. All this is from a single walk. May I also add, the water is drinkable, and in the same walk we also came across numerous edible mushrooms that some were collecting, as well as apples, figs, pears and almonds.
